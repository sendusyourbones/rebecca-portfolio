                        <p>I grew up in San Diego, California and moved to Berkeley, California in 2007 to complete my undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. I have worked as a Program Coordinator and a Business Systems Analyst for UC Berkeley Extension. I was lucky enough to be moved into a Web Developer role there before obtaining any formal education and have been learning a lot on the job; I am now attending the Berkeley Coding Boot Camp to learn even more, and I am already putting my learnings to use at work!</p>
                        <p>I love all things puzzles&mdash;jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, and Wordle, to name a few. I enjoy rock climbing, which is a puzzle with your body. I love coding because it's like a puzzle too!</p>
